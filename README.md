# Connect-Four
A Connect Four game with AI and GUI using pygame in Python.

Considering that Connect Four is a solved game, the AI is kind of mediocre honestly, it can catch you off guard occasionally, 
but it only follows a basic set of rules, ideally I would like to modify it so that it utilises a minimax algorithm instead or make it
play a perfect game, but this is one of my earlier projects.
